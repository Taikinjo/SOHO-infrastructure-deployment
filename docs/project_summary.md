# Project Summary
This project simulates a Small Office / Home Office (SOHO) enterprise network using Cisco Packet Tracer. 
It demonstrates VLAN segmentation, DHCP, NAT, and routing in a scalable Layer 2/3 design.

The topology supports multiple departments (Admin, Sales, Guest) and includes a management VLAN and 
a voice-ready subnet for future VoIP integration.
